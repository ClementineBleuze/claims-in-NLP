# Analysing claims in NLP papers
This repository contains work conducted during a 6-month internship at LORIA (supervisors: KarÃ«n FORT, Maxime AMBLARD, Fanny DUCEL) about the analysis of claims in NLP research, betwee, March-August 2024. It is complementary with an additional [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClementineBleuze/CNP) containing files that are too large to fit here, and a [HuggingFace checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/ClementineBleuze/scibert_prefix_cont_ll_SEP) from which you can download our best model for claim category classification (Weighted F1-score = 0.90).
