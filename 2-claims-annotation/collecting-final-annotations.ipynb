      "For a subset of the utterances in the official test sets, recordings were also made using a desk-mounted Crown microphone. \n",
      "\n",
      "to ensure that benchmark scores will correlate well with user satisfaction and efficiency when the technology is transferred to an application. \n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of using a pre-recorded corpus for evaluation is clear: the same data are used as input to all systems under evaluation, and each system's set of answers is used to automatically generate a benchmark score.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures a uniform input across all systems and removes human involvement from the benchmark testing process (except that human annotators define the reference answers).\n",
      "\n",
      "Any annotated set of data can be used repeatedly for iterative training.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some of these same strengths also impose limitations on what we can evaluate. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, there is the issue of the match between the reference answer and the user's need for useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comparator method can count answers as correct despite system misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a system misrecognizes \"Tuesday\" as \"Wednesday\" and the user realizes that the flight information shown is for Wednesday flights, the user may appropriately believe that the answer is wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if all flights have daily departures, the database answer will be canonically correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, useful (but not strictly correct) answers will be counted wrong, because there is no \"partially correct\" category for answers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, mixed initiative in human-machine dialogue will be required for technology transfer in many spoken language understanding applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the evaluation paradigm actively discourages experimentation with mixed initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "A query that is a response to a systeminitiated query is classified as unevaluable if the user's response can only be understood in the context of the system's query.\n",
      "\n",
      "During evaluation, any system response that is a query will automatically be counted as incorrect (since only database answers can be correct). \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of pre-recorded data also preserves artifacts of the data collection system.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, much of the test data were collected using systems or components of systems to generate responses, rather than a human alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the data include many instances of system errors that affect the user's next query.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user may have to repeat a query several times, or may correct some error that the data collection system (but not the system under evaluation) made.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are artificial phenomena that would disappear if the data collection and evaluation systems were identical. \n",
      "\n",
      "have begun to diverge from those used in benchmark evaluations, in part, because the requirements of demonstrating or using the system are quite different from the requirements for generating reference database answers. \n",
      "\n",
      "These limitations of the comparator-based evaluation preclude the evaluation of certain strategies that are likely to be crucial in technology transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, we need to develop metrics that keep human subjects in the loop and support human-machine interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the use of human subjects introduces new issues in experimental design.\n",
      "\n",
      "A remaining thorny problem is the definition of correct, partially correct, and incorrect answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next evaluation, we need definitions that reflect utility to the user, not just canonical correctness, s Finally, we found that we could not rely on subjects to correctly complete the scenarios presented to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, the subject was not able to find the answer, and in other cases, the subject did not follow directions regarding what information to provide in the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This made it difficult to compute accurate statistics for scenario-level metrics such as task completion and task completion time; this problem was exacerbated by the limited amount of data we collected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we were not able to perform this experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "and would thus require the sites to devote too many resources to issues peripheral to their research, such as database management and query optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation has a significant cost: the comparator-based method requires the deftnition of a training corpus and its collection, defining principles of interpretation, and (most expensively) the annotation of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors identified a noteworthy degree of overfitting in larger models, likely stemming from the insufficient data provided relative to the necessary data volume required to fine-tune numerous parameters. \n",
      "\n",
      "One solution has been proposed for this problem, but the results are not yet satisfactory because of the diversity of the transliteration standards and systems (Fehri et al. 2009). \n",
      "\n",
      "While BST's SSM layer allows the model to unroll and parallelize the recurrence that models longterm context between blocks of tokens, the SSM variants are reliant on efficient FFT operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have found that the FFT operation is an important speed bottleneck on TPUs that needs to be resolved to better scale BST to many layers and larger models.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we are still investigating the reasons, we found that JAX FFT was 4√ó faster on GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, new SSM variants such as S5 [34] bypass FFT operations using a binary associative operator 4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Our implementation is modular enough that we can simply plug in S5 or use other FFT implementations. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of our assumptions is that BST's SSM layer is able to capture the right long-term dependencies for each block.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SSM recurrence at step T = t provides a summarized representation of previous steps for T = 0 to T = t. However, a single vector representation may not be powerful enough to support all important long-term dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the perplexity improvements on long-range language modeling tasks, this assumption needs to be tested on other long-range classification tasks such as Long Range Arena [37] as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that our model can perform better if we feed to the attention layer k = W SSM representations that are chosen by a top-k retrieval operation, similar to the one in Memorizing Transformer [42].\n",

In Patrick & Dekang's term extraction algorithm, wi w2 w3 w4 is generally supposed to be divided into two words or terms (Patrick & Dekang 2001), yet this is very hard to realize, and with the increase of the length of n-grams, the division method of xy can be more various.

      "The current evaluation has brought some important shortcomings of the DOP approach to light. Two important problems, for which solutions are in the making, are briefly discussed below.  The first one is the inadequacy of the definition of subtree probability. It turns out that Bod's equation (3) given on page 3 shows a bias toward analyses derived by subtrees from large corpus trees. The error lies in viewing an annotated corpus as the \"flat\" collection of all its subtrees. Information is lost when the distribution of the analyses that supply the subtrees is ignored. The effect is that a large part of the probability mass is consumed by subtrees stemming from relatively rare, large trees in the tree-bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second shortcoming we will discuss is the fact that existing DOP algorithms are unable to generalise over the syntactic structures in the data. Corpusbased methods such as the current implementation of DOP, assume that the tree-bank which they employ for acquiring the parser, constitutes a rich enough sample of the domain. It is assumed that the part of the annotation scheme that is actually instantiated in the tree-bank does not under-generate on sentences of the domain. This assumption is not met by our current tree-bank.\n",

For a subset of the utterances in the official test sets, recordings were also made using a desk-mounted Crown microphone.  to ensure that benchmark scores will correlate well with user satisfaction and efficiency when the technology is transferred to an application.  The advantage of using a pre-recorded corpus for evaluation is clear: the same data are used as input to all systems under evaluation, and each system's set of answers is used to automatically generate a benchmark score. This approach ensures a uniform input across all systems and removes human involvement from the benchmark testing process (except that human annotators define the reference answers). Any annotated set of data can be used repeatedly for iterative training. However, some of these same strengths also impose limitations on what we can evaluate.  First, there is the issue of the match between the reference answer and the user's need for useful information. The comparator method can count answers as correct despite system misunderstanding. For example, if a system misrecognizes \"Tuesday\" as \"Wednesday\" and the user realizes that the flight information shown is for Wednesday flights, the user may appropriately believe that the answer is wrong. However, if all flights have daily departures, the database answer will be canonically correct. On the other hand, useful (but not strictly correct) answers will be counted wrong, because there is no \"partially correct\" category for answers.  Second, mixed initiative in human-machine dialogue will be required for technology transfer in many spoken language understanding applications. But the evaluation paradigm actively discourages experimentation with mixed initiative. A query that is a response to a systeminitiated query is classified as unevaluable if the user's response can only be understood in the context of the system's query. During evaluation, any system response that is a query will automatically be counted as incorrect (since only database answers can be correct).  The use of pre-recorded data also preserves artifacts of the data collection system. For example, much of the test data were collected using systems or components of systems to generate responses, rather than a human alone. As a result, the data include many instances of system errors that affect the user's next query. A user may have to repeat a query several times, or may correct some error that the data collection system (but not the system under evaluation) made. These are artificial phenomena that would disappear if the data collection and evaluation systems were identical. \n",

      "have begun to diverge from those used in benchmark evaluations, in part, because the requirements of demonstrating or using the system are quite different from the requirements for generating reference database answers.

This made it difficult to compute accurate statistics for scenario-level metrics such as task completion and task completion time; this problem was exacerbated by the limited amount of data we collected.\n",

      "While BST's SSM layer allows the model to unroll and parallelize the recurrence that models longterm context between blocks of tokens, the SSM variants are reliant on efficient FFT operations. We have found that the FFT operation is an important speed bottleneck on TPUs that needs to be resolved to better scale BST to many layers and larger models. While we are still investigating the reasons, we found that JAX FFT was 4√ó faster on GPUs. Further, new SSM variants such as S5 [34] bypass FFT operations using a binary associative operator 4 . Our implementation is modular enough that we can simply plug in S5 or use other FFT implementations.  One of our assumptions is that BST's SSM layer is able to capture the right long-term dependencies for each block. The SSM recurrence at step T = t provides a summarized representation of previous steps for T = 0 to T = t. However, a single vector representation may not be powerful enough to support all important long-term dependencies. Despite the perplexity improvements on long-range language modeling tasks, this assumption needs to be tested on other long-range classification tasks such as Long Range Arena [37] as well.

In translation, for example, resolving the semantic ambiguity of a source preposition is needed when ambiguity cannot be preserved in the target preposition. Finally, we hope that the computational disambiguation of the meanings of prepositions will contribute interesting insights to the linguistic issues concerning the distm\" ction between adjuncts and complements.\n",

In particular, information that can answer the question about who did what to whom, when, why and so on (Johansson and Nugues, 2008;Choi et al., 2010).  There have been many proposed SRL techniques, and the high performing models are mostly supervised (Akbik and Li, 2016;Punyakanok et al., 2004). As they are supervised methods, the models are trained on a relatively large annotated corpus. Building such corpus is expensive as it is laborious, time-consuming, and usually requires expertise in linguistics. For example, Prop-Bank annotation guideline by Choi et al. (2010) is around 90 pages so it can be a steep learning curve even for annotators with a linguistic background. This difficulty makes reproducibility hard for creating annotated data especially in low resource language or different domain of data. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the effort of annotation. He et al. (2015) introduced a Question Answering-driven approach by casting a predicate as a question and its thematic role as an answer in the system. Wang et al. (2017b) used active learning using semantic embedding. Wang et al. (2017a) utilized Annotation Projection with hybrid crowd-sourcing to route between hard instances for linguistic experts and easy instances for non-expert crowds.  Active Learning is the most common method to reduce annotation by using a model to minimize the amount of data to be annotated while maximizing its performance.\n",
